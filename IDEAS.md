### How the operators work depends on the sign of the arguments

```
3 + 4 = "34"
-3 + 4 = "1"
3 + -4 = "3-4"
-3 + -4 = "-7"
```

### Regexes with side effects

Thanks to /u/Daggerbot


### More boolean operators
The `but` operator (if x == 3 but y == 4)

The `then` operator


### Button-mash programming

Somehow make the language make somewhat useful stuff if you button mash, the same way you can win by button mashing in Street Fighter. Maybe make the interpreter detect button mashing and output code like hackertyper

### A go-back-one-level operator
This operator would return the name of the value. So if this operator was `^`, code would look like this:
```
A = 1
A*
>> 1
1^
>> A
```
There will be several possible values, so a way of specifing which one has to be defined. Or maybe just have a sensible default. Or maybe don't allow a value to be referenced by more than one name (besides itself)

### A way to assign several values to a single name
This would allow trees to be implemented with names, not just linked lists. Also, this would make the `^` operator be consistent with `*`, since they both would result in multiple possiblities.
