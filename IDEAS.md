### How the operators work depends on the sign of the arguments

```
3 + 4 = "34"
-3 + 4 = "1"
3 + -4 = "3-4"
-3 + -4 = "-7"
```

### Regexes with side effects

Thanks to /u/Daggerbot


### More boolean operators
The `but` operator (if x == 3 but y == 4)

The `then` operator


### Button-mash programming

Somehow make the language make somewhat useful stuff if you button mash, the same way you can win by button mashing in Street Fighter. Maybe make the interpreter detect button mashing and output code like hackertyper
